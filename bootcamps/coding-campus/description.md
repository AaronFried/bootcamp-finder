In a past life the V School team founded Verisage, a custom dev shop building beautiful, world-class web and mobile apps for clients and friends.

In doing this good work they noticed that often, their clients would be in need of full stack developers to round-out their internal teams and scale the products that Verisage was helping them build.

Enter V School, an institution focused on identifying people with high aptitude for coding and accelerating them through an intensive training program. Upon finishing this immersive education, this new wave of highly trained, full stack junior devs was ready to tackle projects for the dev shop, as well as pursue inspiring full-time work in a new technical career of their choice.

V School's mission is to improve the human experience by continuing to modernize education, accelerating career readiness and increasing community engagement by providing platforms, training and tools to foster innovation and create economic opportunities around the globe.
