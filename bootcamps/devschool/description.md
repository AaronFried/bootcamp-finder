At Devschool we combine a guided, progressive, real world approach to
teaching software and web development. Instead of creating artificial
hoops, courses and classrooms, they focus on having students build a real
application. Every student builds a different application and every student
has a different time-line based on their own availability.

Devschool doesn't interview for talent, instead they look for people who
can demonstrate that they have the drive to put in the hours and effort it
takes to become a paid programmer. Along with proving you are serious about
learning to code, you will need to pass the "no jerk" test.

Your Instructor will begin by doing filling in all of your 'gaps. You will
not just be taught to code, but to code with team-mates, and they will even
focus on getting you to use your Mac like a pro, navigating with the
keyboard and writing code in Vim.

Towards the end of your 50 private Instructor sessions they will begin
coaching you on how to hunt for and land paying work as a programmer, how
to interview, and they even help you solve and understand code challenges.
At Devschool, you graduate when you get a job, you don't graduate and then
flounder looking for a job.
