I was looking at Viking Code School and Learn.co, when I came across Devschool. After interviewing with them, I joined, and I was immediately happy I did! I actually tried other online bootcamps and just got tired of the old, and dated curriculum. 

What makes this school awesome is Jim OKelly. He is a fantastic and patient instructor. And the guy knows his stuff. He not only pushes you to learn full stack web development, he pushes you to learn the tools and to learn them well, such as Vim, CLI, etc. There's no sitting through boring curriculum, like other schools. From day one, you start building YOUR (first of many )web apps, and then another one, and then another one. Meanwhile you and other students watch him build out real business web apps where you can ask questions, watching a senior level programmer solve problems, etc.

Also, the other students in the program are awesome. Some are ahead of you, and some are just coming in, but all of them have a common goal, and it's great to communicate and solve problems together. You get to pair with someone after you've been in the program for a bit.

Those who need a rigid, structured curriculum of hand-holding will not like this school. But those who want a real-world web developement environment while they learn, who like to see how requirements for software can and will change, and who want to learn how to communicate effectively and well with team members on their future job, will LOVE this program. It really is almost like you're an intern learning from a Sr. developer the whole software life cycle stuff.

Jim is very giving, patient, and knowlegeable, and he has that much needed and remarkable trait of all good teachers: he knows how to break difficult concepts down to beginners.  Like I've said, I've studied with other mentors, and they were excellent programmers and knew their stuff, but they sucked at breaking down difficult concepts. Jim is a fantastic mentor, vastly knowledgeable, dedicated, and sincere to his students' success.
