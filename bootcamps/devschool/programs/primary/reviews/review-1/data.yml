headline: "Through Codementor, I found Jim and made him my long term mentor through months 2-3 of Dev Bootcamp and I ended up getting a partial refund at DBC and joined the brand new (then) Devschool. I really liked how the curriculum wasn't written out ahead of time when what I wanted to build and learn was anything but static. I would recommend Devschool to anyone who wants to cut through the cruft and really, really learn the skills they will need to build modern web applications."
