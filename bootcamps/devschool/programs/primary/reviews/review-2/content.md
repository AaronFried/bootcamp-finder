I would highly recommend Jim and Devschool for any prospective students out there! I have been a student for about 4 months and have learned a ton. Initially I wanted to find a program to help me transition from IT support to a developer and find a programmer job. I now have that developer job and I owe a big thanks to Devschool for helping me develop the required skills to get it.

I originally found Jim when I was using CodeMentor.io to level up my skills. Jim was one of the top 10 Ruby/Rails teachers in the space. When I started my education with Jim, I realized that I had some gaps in my skills that I needed to work on. Jim was patient while I worked through initial bumps along the way. Jim does a great job of breaking down difficult topics into easy digestible pieces that I can understand. I am still working with Devschool to continue to level up with the latest technologies and make sure I use best coding practices going forward.
