Hi my name is Eric. I just graduated from Devschool. Jim placed me at a Y Combinator start up called New Story and I'm super pumped about it. I'll be working on doing Ruby on Rails for them and couldn't be happier.  I picked Devschool because you literally get one on one time and mentorship and they guarenteed placement. It only took him about 7 days to place me after I graduated. Thank you so much Jim & Devchool!!! I wouldn't have been able to get into programming without you.
