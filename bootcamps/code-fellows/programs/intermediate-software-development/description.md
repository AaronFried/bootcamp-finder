Code 301 takes intermediate students and trains them in concepts beyond the syntax programming languages, covering how to use professional-grade tools and APIs to streamline the development process and build large-scale, interactive web applications.

Students study the common core of software development, including MVC, Object-Oriented Programming, functional programming, asynchronous programming, and much more in this intensive course.

This course is offered as a full-time course over four weeks, or a part-time course over eight weeks. Scholarships and financing are available.
