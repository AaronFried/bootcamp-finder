reviews:
- Worth it? Yes. Clear eyes, full hearts, can't lose!
- I've never learned so much in my life. The material was top notch, the flipped classroom approach (where you actually coded for 6 out of 8 hours in the day) did wonders, and the experienced engineer team was brilliant and knowledgeable.
- Launch Academy is a very intense and hardcore immersive learning experience. The pace that myself and everyone was learning was incredible.
